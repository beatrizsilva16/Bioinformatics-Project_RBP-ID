# RBP-ID: Development of a web-based bioinformatic tool for the identification of phage Receptor Binding Proteins

Bacteriophages (phages) are viruses that infect only bacteria
and are the most abundant biological entities on Earth. An important
characteristic of phages is their high specificity to their host. This specificity is mediate by proteins called receptor binding proteins - RBPs.
These proteins are structures of the phage particle that recognize specific molecules on the surface of bacterial cell walls. RBPs present an
enormous potential in biotechnical applications, not only to allow the
creation of tailor-made phages through genetic modification of phage
RBP but also to create new weapons and new diagnostic methods tar-
geting pathogenic bacteria. However, the high diversity of phage RBP
and their low sequence conservation turns difficult to identify them, pre-
cluding their use in the development of new biotechnological applications.
Besides the growing development of bioinformatics and the potential of
these proteins, a tool able to identify them is still inexistent, a gap that
needs to be filled.
